<Save/>

-   Function introduction

    -   The upper left corner is the existing data structure in the database

    -   The upper right corner is the data structure the user wants to save 
    
    -   The operations executed by Jimmer are below.  

        Within the scope **affected by** the shape of the data structure the user wants to save, Jimmer compares the new and old data structures, and performs <span style={{color: 'green'}}>insert</span>, <span style={{color: 'orange'}}>update</span> or even <span style={{color: 'red'}}>delete</span> on the changed parts.

        :::tip
        If you understand [react](https://react.dev/) or [vue](https://vuejs.org/), it is easy to see that this feature is very similar to `Virtual DOM diff`.

-   Differences from JPA

    -   In JPA, whether ordinary properties of objects need to be saved is controlled by [Column.insertable](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/persistence/Column.html#insertable--) and
        [Column.updatable](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/persistence/Column.html#updatable--),
        and whether association properties need to be saved is controlled by [OneToOne.cascade](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/persistence/OneToOne.html#cascade--), 
        [ManyToOne.cascade](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/persistence/ManyToOne.html#cascade--),
        [OneToMany.cascade](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/persistence/OneToMany.html#cascade--) or
        [ManyToMany.cascade](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/persistence/ManyToMany.html#cascade--).
        No matter how developers configure them, the shape of the data structure that can be saved is fixed.
            
        While in Jimmer, there are no such configurations at all. The behavior of ORM depends entirely on the shape of the dynamic objects the user wants to save, with almost infinite possibilities.

    -   In JPA, if an association is bidirectional, only the owning side can be used to save data, while the inverse side *(with `mappedBy`)* cannot be used to modify data. In Jimmer, both sides of a bidirectional association are equal, and either side can be used to modify data.

        Therefore, if a certain bidirectional association in Jimmer allows the user to choose one side as the inverse side *(with `mappedBy`)*, the choice can be quite arbitrary.
