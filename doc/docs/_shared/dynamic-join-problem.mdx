Currently, other technologies that operate on SQL, whether ORM or non-ORM, have a blank area: they only consider dynamic `where`, and do not consider `dynamic join`.

`Dynamic JOIN` is defined as: If some dynamic query conditions are for tables other than the current table. This means

- When the condition is met: First join to other tables through association properties, then add dynamic where conditions to the joined table

- When the condition is not met: Cannot join other tables through association properties

## Scene-1

Let's first look at the first scene, taking MyBatis oriented to native SQL as an example

-   Define MyBatis Mapper interface

    ```java
    @Mapper
    public interface BookMapper {

        List<Book> findBooks(
            @Nullable String name,
            @Nullable String storeName, 
            @Nullable String storeWebsite
        );
    }
    ```

    Here, all query parameters may be null, which is clearly a dynamic query.

    The last two query parameters: `storeName` and `storeWebsite`, their filtering conditions are not applied on the current table `BOOK`, but on the parent table `BOOK_STORE`.
    That is, when any of these two parameters is non-null, a JOIN to the `BOOK_STORE` table will be generated. This table join dynamically determined by the parameter value is referred to as `dynamic JOIN` in this article.

-   Define MyBatis SQL mapping XML

    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
    <!DOCTYPE mapper
            PUBLIC "-//mybatis.org//DTD Mapper 3.0//EN"
            "http://mybatis.org/dtd/mybatis-3-mapper.dtd">
    <mapper namespace="somepackage.BookMapper">
        <select id="findBooks" resultType="somepackage.Book">
            select * from BOOK as book
            <!-- highlight-next-line -->
            <if test="storeName != null or storeWebsite != null"> ❶
                inner join BOOK_STORE as store
                    on book.STORE_ID = store.ID
            </if>
            <where>
                <if test="name != null">
                    and book.NAME = #{name}
                </if>
                <if test="storeName != null"> ❷
                    and store.NAME = #{storeName}
                </if>
                <if test="storeWebsite != null">
                    and store.WEBSITE = #{storeWebsite} ❸
                </if>
            </where>
        </select>
    </mapper>
    ```
    
    Here, ❶ is the dynamic JOIN. However, for developers, ❷ and ❸ are the purpose, and ❶ is the work that has to be done to support ❷ and ❸. Its judgment condition is a burden.

    You may have noticed that ❶ uses `or`. This is easy to understand.
    
    **However, this is only the simplest dynamic connection between two tables. For deeper multi-table join operations, the complexity of dynamic connections will increase dramatically!**

## Scene-2

Let's take a look at the second scene. With the previous example as the basis, this example is decoupled from any business.

```xml 
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<!DOCTYPE mapper
    PUBLIC "-//mybatis.org//DTD Mapper 3.0//EN"
    "http://mybatis.org/dtd/mybatis-3-mapper.dtd">
<mapper namespace="somepackage.AMapper">
  <select id="findAObjects" resultType="somepackage.A">
    select distinct A.id
    from A
    <!-- highlight-start -->  
    <if test="bId != null or cId != null or dId != null or eId != null">
      inner join B on A.ID = B.A_ID 
    </if>
    <if test="cId != null or dId != null or eId != null">
      inner join C on B.ID = C.B_ID
    </if>
    <if test="dId != null or eId != null">
      inner join D on C.ID = D.C_ID 
    </if>
    <if test="eId != null">
      inner join E on D.ID = E.D_ID
    </if>
    <!-- highlight-end -->
    <where>
      <if test="aId != null">
        and A.ID = #{aId}  
      </if>
      <if test="bId != null">
        and B.ID = #{bId}
      </if>
      <if test="cId != null">
        and C.ID = #{cId}
      </if>
      <if test="dId != null">
        and D.ID = #{dId}
      </if>
      <if test="eId != null">
        and E.ID = #{eId}
      </if>
    </where>
  </select>
</mapper>
```

The logic of this example is simple. The five tables A, B, C, D and E form a JOIN chain, and each table has a dynamic query condition. However, as you can see, the complexity of dynamic JOIN has become unacceptable.
