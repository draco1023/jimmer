Jimmer focuses only on the ORM itself and does not provide auxiliary tools, such as generating entity interface definitions based on the database structure. 

Enthusiastic people have contributed related tools, welcome everyone to actively contribute related tools, and submit PRs for me to include them in the list. As of now, the collected projects are:
