In this section, we will introduce the various queries in Jimmer without considering [Cache](../cache). 

There are three groundbreaking capabilities:

-   [Object Fetcher](./object-fetcher)

    One statement to query data structure of arbitrary shape, like [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)

-   [Dynamic Join](./dynamic-join)

    This addresses a huge industry gap, enabling easy complex dynamic queries

-   [Smart Paging](./paging) 

    Users only focus on querying the raw data, row count queries are auto-generated and optimized for convenience
