## Define Logical Delete Flag

Jimmer supports logical delete, for example

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java title="Book.java"  
@Entity
public interface Book {

    @LogicalDeleted(
        value = "true",
        // highlight-next-line
        useMultiViewCache = true
    )
    boolean isDeleted();

    ...other code omitted...
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin title="Book.kt"
@Entity
interface Book {

    @LogicalDeleted(
        value = "true",
        // highlight-next-line
        useMultiViewCache = true
    )
    val isDeleted: Boolean

    ...other code omitted...
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Here is the English translation:

:::caution 

The `useMultiViewCache = true` in the above code is very important. 

The `@LogicalDeleted` uses the built-in global filter to implement the logical delete logic. 

-   If `useMultiViewCache` of `@LogicalDeleted` annotation is false, 
    the corresponding built-in filter only implements `Filter/KFilter` interfaces, which is unfriendly to cache. 
    
-   If `useMultiViewCache` of `@LogicalDeleted` annotation is true, 
    the corresponding built-in filter only implements `CacheableFilter/KCacheableFilter` interfaces, which is cache-friendly. 
    
The default value of this property is `false`, indicating that all properties sensitive to the build-in filter 
*(`BookStore.books`, `Author.books`, `BookStore.avgPrice`, and `BookStore.newestBooks` of the example)* do NOT support cache, 
which is a more conservative option. 

To make all these properties cacheable, `useMultiViewCache = true` must be configured. 
:::

## Enable multi-view cache

How to enable multi-view cache has already been discussed in detail in the [previous document](./user-filter), 
so I will not repeat it here.

## SubKey of Calculated Properties  

Logical delete is a built-in filter, and all affected association properties will automatically specify `SubKey` for their association caches.

However, unfortunately, due to the introduction of user-defined calculation rules that the framework cannot understand, developers must manually specify `SubKey` for the `TransientResolver` implementation of calculated properties.

<Tabs groupId="language"> 
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java title="BookStoreAvgPriceResolver.java"
@Component
public class BookStoreAvgPriceResolver implements TransientResolver<Long, BigDecimal> {
    
    private final JSqlClient sqlClient;

    @Override
    public Ref<SortedMap<String, Object>> getParameterMapRef() {
        return sqlClient
            .getFilters()
            // highlight-next-line
            .getTargetParameterMapRef(BookStoreProps.BOOKS);
    }

    ...other code omitted...
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin title="BookStoreAvgPriceResolver.kt" 
@Compoent
class BookStoreAvgPriceResolver(
    private val sqlClient: KSqlClient
) : KTransientResolver<Long, BigDecimal> {

    override fun getParameterMapRef(): Ref<SortedMap<String, Any>?>? {
        return sqlClient
            .filters
            // highlight-next-line
            .getTargetParameterMapRef(BookStore::books)
    }

    ...other code omitted... 
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Obviously, the calculated property `BookStore.avgPrice` is actually determined by the association property `BookStore.books` and changes with it. 

Therefore, whatever `SubKey` the association property `BookStore.books` specifies for the multi-view cache system in the current invocation context, the calculated property `BookStore.avgPrice` should specify the same one.

:::note
`BookStore.avgPrice` is also affected by `Book.price`. It changes when `Book.price` changes.

However, `Book.price` is a non-associative property of the object, so it is irrelevant to the multi-view cache system. The `getParameterMapRef` method does not need to consider it here.
:::

## Usage  

### Normal Usage

Now that we have made the association property `BookStore.books` and the calculated property `BookStore.avgPrice` support multi-view cache, let's use object fetchers to query them

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
BookStoreTable table = BookStoreTable.$;
List<BookStore> stores = sqlClient
    .createQuery(table)
    .select(
        table.fetch(
            BookStoreFetcher.$
                .allScalarFields()
                .books( ❶
                    BookFetcher.$
                        .allScalarFields()
                )
                .avgPrice() ❷
        )
    )
    .execute();
System.out.println(stores); 
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">  

```kotlin
val stores = sqlClient
    .createQuery(BookStore::class) {
        select(
            table.fetchBy {
                allScalarFields()
                books { ❶
                    allScalarFields()
                }
                avgPrice() ❷
            }
        )
    }
    .execute()
println(stores)
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

-   Step 1: Query the aggregate root

    First query the aggregate root objects by executing the following SQL
    
    ```sql
    select
        tb_1_.ID,
        tb_1_.NAME,
        tb_1_.WEBSITE 
    from BOOK_STORE tb_1_
    ```

    This implements the query in the code and obtains some BookStore objects. Such objects directly queried by users are called aggregate root objects.

-   Step 2: Query `BookStore.books` ❶ via association cache

    The above code will obtain a list of aggregate root objects. If using the official sample data, it will get two aggregate root objects with `ID` of 1 and 2.

    Jimmer first looks up the data in Redis with keys `BookStore.books-1` and `BookStore.books-2`. 

    Assuming the data for these keys cannot be found in Redis
    ```
    127.0.0.1:6379> keys BookStore.books-*
    (empty array)
    ```

    Then the following SQL is executed to resolve the association property `BookStore.books`
    ```sql
    select
        tb_1_.STORE_ID,
        tb_1_.ID
    from BOOK tb_1_  
    where
            tb_1_.STORE_ID in (
                ? /* 1 */, ? /* 2 */  
            )
        and
            // highlight-next-line
            tb_1_.DELETED = ? /* false */
    order by
        tb_1_.NAME asc, 
        tb_1_.EDITION desc
    ```

    :::info
    The filtering condition `tb_1_.DELETED = false` comes from the implicit built-in filter of the logical delete feature. 
    :::

    Jimmer will put the query results into Redis, so we can view the data in redis:
    ```sh
    127.0.0.1:6379> keys BookStore.books-*  
    1) "BookStore.books-2"
    2) "BookStore.books-1"

    127.0.0.1:6379> hgetall BookStore.books-1
    # highlight-next-line  
    1) "{\"logicalDeleted\":false}"
    2) "[6,5,3,2,9,8]"

    127.0.0.1:6379> hgetall BookStore.books-2
    # highlight-next-line
    1) "{\"logicalDeleted\":false}" 
    2) "[12,11]"
    ```
    :::info
    The multi-view cache uses Redis Hash structure, so the `hgetall` command of redis is needed instead of simple `get`. 

    Redis Hash is a nested two-layer KV structure.

    -   The outer layer Redis Key like `BookStore.books-1` and `BookStore.books-2` is no different from keys in single-view cache.

    -   The inner layer Hash Key, also called SubKey in Jimmer, is the parameter of global filters.

        Here, `{"logicalDeleted":false}` is provided by the built-in global filter of logical delete, indicating the cached value is not the collection of ids of all associated objects, but only the ids of those undeleted associated objects.
    :::

    :::tip
    Undoubtedly, if the cached data in Redis is not cleared due to timeout, executing the above Java/Kotlin code again will directly return the association data from Redis without generating related SQL.
    :::

    -   Step 3: Convert id collection to associated objects

        In the previous step, we obtained the collection of ids of the associated objects corresponding to the association property `BookStore.books`. They are all undeleted objects.  

        Now we can use the object cache of `Book` type to convert the `Book` id collection to `Book` collection. 

        This step is very simple and needs no discussion.

    - Step 4: Query `BookStore.avgPrice` ❷ via calculated cache 

        The above code will obtain a list of aggregate root objects. If using the official sample data, there will be two aggregate root objects with `ID` of 1 and 2.

        Jimmer first looks up the data in Redis with keys `BookStore.avgPrice-1` and `BookStore.avgPrice-2`.

    Assuming the data for these keys cannot be found in Redis
    ```
    127.0.0.1:6379> keys BookStore.avgPrice-* 
    (empty array)
    ```

    Then the following SQL is executed to compute the calculated property
    ```sql
    select 
        tb_1_.ID,
        avg(tb_2_.PRICE)
    from BOOK_STORE tb_1_
    left join BOOK tb_2_
        on tb_1_.ID = tb_2_.STORE_ID
    where
            tb_1_.ID in (
                ? /* 1 */, ? /* 2 */  
            )
        and
            // highlight-next-line
            tb_1_.DELETED = ? /* false */
    group by 
        tb_1_.ID
    ```

### Adjust Filtering Behavior

In the [Logical Delete](../../query/global-filter/logical-deleted) documentation, we introduced that the logical delete filter can be ignored or even reversed.

-   Ignore filtering behavior

    <Tabs groupId="language">
    <TabItem value="java" label="Java">

    ```java  
    BookTable table = BookTable.$;

    List<Book> books = sqlClient
        .filters(cfg -> {
            // highlight-next-line
            cfg.disable(
                cfg
                    .getFilterManager()
                    .builtIns()
                    .getDeclaredNotDeletedFilter(Book.class)
            ); 
        })
        .createQuery(table)
        .select(table)
        .execute();
    ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

    ```kotlin
    val books = sqlClient
        .filters {
            // highlight-next-line 
            disable(
                filterManager
                    .builtIns
                    .getDeclaredNotDeletedFilter(Book::class)
            )
        }
        .createQuery(table)
        .select(table)
        .execute() 
    ```

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    After executing the code, if the cached information entered in the previous example has not been cleared, the latest data in Redis should be:

    ```sh
    127.0.0.1:6379> keys BookStore.books-*
    1) "BookStore.books-2"
    2) "BookStore.books-1"

    127.0.0.1:6379> hgetall BookStore.books-1
    1) "{\"logicalDeleted\":false}"
    2) "[6,5,3,2,9,8]"
    # highlight-next-line
    3) "{}"
    4) "[6,5,4,3,2,1,9,8,7]"

    127.0.0.1:6379> hgetall BookStore.books-2
    1) "{\"logicalDeleted\":false}"
    2) "[12,11]" 
    # highlight-next-line
    3) "{}"
    4) "[12,11,10]"

    127.0.0.1:6379> keys BookStore.avgPrice-*
    1) "BookStore.avgPrice-2"
    2) "BookStore.avgPrice-1"

    127.0.0.1:6379> hgetall BookStore.avgPrice-1
    1) "{\"logicalDeleted\":false}"
    2) "59.333333"
    # highlight-next-line
    3) "{}"
    4) "58.5"

    127.0.0.1:6379> hgetall BookStore.avgPrice-2 
    1) "{\"logicalDeleted\":false}"
    2) "80.5"
    # highlight-next-line
    3) "{}"
    4) "8.333333"
    ```

    -   The outer layer Redis Keys like `BookStore.books-1`, `BookStore.books-2`, `BookStore.avgPrice-1` and `BookStore.avgPrice-2` are no different from keys in single-view cache.

    -   The inner layer Hash Keys, also called SubKeys in Jimmer, are the parameters of transient resolvers. 

        `{}` is the corresponding SubKey for this example, and the corresponding cached value is the data when the filter is ignored. This is also what we see in the documentation about single-view cache.

-   Reverse filtering behavior

        .execute()
    ```

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    After executing the code, if the cached information entered in the previous example has not been cleared, the latest data in Redis should be:

    ```sh
    127.0.0.1:6379> keys BookStore.books-*
    1) "BookStore.books-2"
    2) "BookStore.books-1"

    1) "BookStore.avgPrice-2"
    2) "BookStore.avgPrice-1"
    
    127.0.0.1:6379> hgetall BookStore.avgPrice-1
    3) "{}"

    2) "80.5"
    # highlight-next-line
    1) "{\"logicalDeleted\":true}"
    2) "80"
    ```

    -   The outer layer Redis Keys like `BookStore.books-1`, `BookStore.books-2`, `BookStore.avgPrice-1` and `BookStore.avgPrice-2` are no different from keys in single-view cache.

    -   The inner layer Hash Keys, also called SubKeys in Jimmer, are the parameters of global filters.

        `{"logicalDeleted":true}` is the corresponding SubKey for this example, indicating the cached value depends on the deleted associated data rather than all associated data, which is the opposite of the default filtering logic.

    :::tip
    Readers can take a close look at these `redis-cli` commands and easily find that the data of SubKey `{"logicalDeleted":false}` merged with the data of SubKey `{"logicalDeleted":true}` is exactly the data of SubKey `{}`.
    :::

## Cache Invalidation

Now let's modify the logical delete flag of the `Book` object with id 6.

Since `Book-6` belongs to `BookStore-1`, it is foreseeable that the multi-view caches corresponding to the properties `BookStore.books-1` and `BookStore.avgPrice-1` will definitely be invalidated.

-   If BinLog trigger is enabled, modifying the database in any way can lead to Jimmer's cache consistency involvement. For example, directly executing the following SQL in SQL IDE

    ```sql
    update BOOK  
    set DELETED = true
    where ID = 6;
    ```

-   If only Transaction trigger is enabled, the database must be modified using Jimmer's API

    <Tabs groupId="language">
    <TabItem value="java" label="Java">

    ```java
    sqlClient.deleteById(Book.class, 6L, DeleteMode.LOGICAL)
    ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

    ```kotlin
    sqlClient.deleteById(Book::class, 6L, DeleteMode.LOGICAL)
    ```

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    :::info
    Since the `Book` entity is configured with a logical delete field, the default delete policy is logical delete. So the `DeleteMode.LOGICAL` above can actually be omitted. It is written explicitly here just for emphasis.
    :::

No matter which way above is used to modify the data, you will see the following log output:

```
Delete data from redis: [Book-6] ❶
Delete data from redis: [Author.books-3] ❷
Delete data from redis: [BookStore.books-1] ❸
Delete data from redis: [BookStore.avgPrice-1] ❹
```

-   ❶ Update object cache of modified entity 

-   ❷ Any association property targeting `Book` must be affected, of course including `Author.books`

    According to existing database data, the affected `Author` object id is 3

-   ❸ Any association property targeting `Book` must be affected, of course including `BookStore.books`

    According to existing database data, the affected `BookStore` object id is 1  

-   ❹ The calculated cache `BookStore.avgPrice` of `BookStore` object with id 1 is also affected. This is the most amazing characteristic. 

    If you have forgotten the specific logic of this code, you can review the following code in the [Calculated Cache](../cache-type/calculation) documentation:

    <Tabs groupId="language">
    <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

    ```kotlin
    @EventListener
    fun onAssociationChange(e: AssociationEvent) {
        if (sqlClient.caches.isAffectedBy(e) && 
            // highlight-next-line
            e.isChanged(BookStore::books)
        ) {
            ...code omitted...
        }
    }
    ```

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    If you focus on the highlighted line, this calculated property cares about changes to the association property `BookStore.books`.

    :::tip
    Modifying the association field between tables is not the only way to trigger association change events. Modifying the filtered field in associated objects, *like `DELETED` here*, can also trigger association change events.  

    This is a very important characteristic of Jimmer's trigger mechanism!
    :::

    It is obvious that ❸ has already sensed the change of association property `BookStore.books`, so it will further lead to the invalidation of the calculated cache here.
