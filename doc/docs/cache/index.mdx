Jimmer provides powerful cache support capabilities.

-   Whether to use cache is completely transparent to developers

-   Which caching technologies to use is decided by developers

-   Not only does it support simple <ViewMore buttonText="object cache"><ObjectCache/></ViewMore>, 
    but also property-level cache, including <ViewMore buttonText="association cache"><AssociationCache/></ViewMore> and <ViewMore buttonText="calculated cache"><CalculatedCache/></ViewMore>.
    Ultimately it provides the ability to cache arbitrary data structures, not just simple object cache.

-   Features represented by permission systems allow different users to see different data. Therefore, Jimmer uses <ViewMore buttonText="multi-view cache"><MultiViewCache/></ViewMore> to allow different users to see different caches.

-   Powerful cache consistency support. Developers can focus on modifying the database and Jimmer will automatically <ViewMore buttonText="invalidate cache"><CacheConsistencyPanel/></ViewMore>.
