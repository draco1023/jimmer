title: Cache Consistency
---

:::caution
In previous articles on [object cache](./cache-type/object), [association cache](./cache-type/association), and [calculated cache](./cache-type/calculation), we have discussed in detail how Jimmer automatically deletes affected caches when data is modified.

So here we will not repeat the discussion of how Jimmer intelligently invalidates affected caches. 

The focus of this article is how Jimmer ensures cache deletion operations issued can definitely succeed.
:::

Whether it is the fully automatic invalidation of [object cache](./cache-type/object) and [association cache](./cache-type/association), or the user assisted invalidation of [calculated cache](./cache-type/calculation), the cache consistency of Jimmer is driven by [triggers](../mutation/trigger).

Jimmer triggers are divided into BinLog triggers and Transaction triggers.

For different situations, Jimmer adopts different strategies to ensure cache consistency, that is, to ensure that cache invalidation operations must succeed.


## Consistency of BinLog Trigger (Recommended)

When `trigger-type` is `BINLOG_ONLY` or `BOTH`, Jimmer uses the BinLog trigger to invalidate caches.

In this case, developers respond to messaging queue notifications, process them simply and then call Jimmer's `BinLog` API *(this user code is very simple, and its complexity can be ignored)*. Calling the `BinLog` API initiates all trigger callbacks, including cache invalidation.

Take Kafka as an example, make sure to commit the consumption progress after successfully calling the `BinLog` API, cache invalidation can be guaranteed to eventually succeed.

## Consistency of Transaction Trigger 

When `trigger-type` is `TRANSACTION_ONLY`, Jimmer will be **forced** to use the Transaction trigger to invalidate caches.

For Transaction triggers:

-   Only modifying the database through Jimmer's own API can trigger all callback behaviors.

-   All trigger callbacks complete before the transaction is committed.

If a simple implementation of direct cache invalidation is adopted, any exception during cache invalidation will cause the transaction to be rolled back. Obviously, this implementation is not reasonable.

Therefore, when `trigger-type` is `TRANSACTION_ONLY`, the cache invalidation operations perceived by the user will be delayed, they will not be executed immediately, but are stored in the `JIMMER_TRANS_CACHE_OPERATOR` table. 

:::caution  
Jimmer will automatically create the `JIMMER_TRANS_CACHE_OPERATOR` table.

However, the default `org.babyfish.jimmer.sql.dialect.DefaultDialect` does not support this operation and will throw an exception.

Therefore, if cache consistency needs to be driven by transaction trigger, don't use the default `DefaultDialect`, please explicitly specify the database dialect.
:::

Modifications to the `JIMMER_TRANS_CACHE_OPERATOR` table and business tables belong to the same database local transaction, either both succeed or both fail.

After the transaction commits successfully, Jimmer will immediately execute a `Flush` operation.

The so-called `Flush` operation is to query cache invalidation operations that have not yet been executed from the `JIMMER_TRANS_CACHE_OPERATOR` table, execute the actual cache invalidation operation, and delete related records if successful.

For the `Flush` operation executed immediately after transaction commit:

-   If successful, it's best to have good real-time. This should be the case most of the time.

-   Even if it fails, it doesn't matter. Jimmer will periodically execute `Flush` operations to ensure related cache invalidation eventually succeed. 

    The interval of `Flush` operations is controlled by the global SpringBoot configuration item `jimmer.transaction-cache-operator-fixed-delay`, which is specified in milliseconds and defaults to 5000.
