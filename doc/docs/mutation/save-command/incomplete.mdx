title: Incomplete Object

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';

The parameter of a save command is a dynamic object. If some of the properties are not specified, then the object is an incomplete object.

To demonstrate the value of incomplete objects, let's look at a real example - changing the many-to-one association `store` of the `Book` with id `8` to null. 

It seems there are two ways to implement this functionality:

-   Execute an UPDATE statement via [update statements](../update-statement)

-   Query the `Book` object, change its `store` property to null, and save it

Most developers prefer the second approach. So in this article, we will discuss the second approach.

## JPA Example

Before introducing Jimmer's support for saving incomplete objects, let's first see how to implement this with JPA:

```java title="JPA Example" 
EntityManager entityManager = ...get JPA session from current transaction context, omitted...
Book book = entityManager.find(Book.class, 8L);

book.setStore(null); // JPA entities are mutable, change association to null

// Calling merge here just for clarity, can be omitted since JPA will update db on tx commit anyway
entityManager.merge(book);
```

Apart from setting `store` to null, we do not know the existing values of other properties. In JPA, constrained by the fixed shape of plain POJO entities, we have to query all properties of the object, modify the `store` property *(keeping others unchanged)*, and save the object again. 

Even if the object has hundreds of properties, we have to do this, which is obviously wasteful.

## Jimmer Example

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
sqlClient.update(
    BookDraft.$.produce(draft -> {
        draft.setId(8L);
        draft.setStore(null);
    })
);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
sqlClient.update(
    new(Book::class).by {
        id = 8L
        store = null
    }
);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

-   Explicitly use `update` *(or `save(book, SaveMode.UPDATE_ONLY)`)* to indicate this is an update operation, avoiding the probing query of the `UPSERT` mode to simplify the discussion.

-   **Make up** a Book object out of thin air, only assigning its `id` property and `store` property, while all other properties are unknown.

    This incomplete object tells Jimmer to not modify any other properties except `store`.
  
Jimmer will directly generate the following SQL:

```sql
update BOOK
set
    STORE_ID = ? /* <null: long> */  
where
    ID = ? /* 8 */
```
