In this section, we will introduce all the capabilities in Jimmer related to modifying the database. 

There are two groundbreaking capabilities:

-   [Save Command](./save-command)

    One statement to save complex data of arbitrary shape, find DIFF to change database, like React/Vue.

-   [Triggers](./trigger) 

    Awareness of data changes whether via Jimmer's own capabilities or integrating with existing CDC solutions. This enables automatic [Caching](../cache) invalidation.
