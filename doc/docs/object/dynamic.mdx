:::info
The example code in this article uses a type called `BookDraft`, which is an interface type automatically generated by Jimmer based on the user-defined type `Book`.

Readers can ignore this auto-generated interface for now. The later document [Draft](./draft) will introduce it.

## Characteristics of Dynamic Objects

For missing properties:

-   Using code to access them directly will result in an exception `org.babyfish.jimmer.UnloadedException`

    :::note
    If the reader has Hibernate experience, think of this as `org.hibernate.LazyInitializationException`.

-   In [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) serialization, they will be automatically ignored.

    :::info
    This requires some configuration for [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson). Since this detail is very important, it has been made into a separate document. Please refer to [Work with Jackson](./jackson).

## Interaction with ORM

Dynamicity is an intrinsic characteristic of Jimmer objects and is universally applicable. Both the ORM framework itself and developers can easily build dynamic objects for each other to use.

-   Jimmer creates dynamic objects and returns them to developers

    That is, query data structures of any shape. This feature is called [object fetchers](../query/object-fetcher).

-   Developers create dynamic objects and pass them to Jimmer

    That is, save data structures of any shape. This feature is called [save commands](../mutation/save-command). 

### Object Fetchers

Jimmer creates dynamic objects and returns them to developers

<ObjectFetcherPanel/>

### Save Commands

Developers create dynamic objects and pass them to Jimmer  

<SaveCommandPanel/>
