import ImmutableProblem from "../../_shared/immutable-problem.mdx";

Java has supported immutable record types since Java 14, and Kotlin's data classes can easily implement immutable classes, even supporting copy functions. However, they are designed for simple immutable objects, and have problems dealing with complex deep data structure.

The reason why deep, complex immutable objects are difficult to handle is not how to create a brand new data structure from scratch, which is very simple for any programming language. The real difficulty is wanting to make some local adjustments to an existing data structure and build a new data structure. This is very difficult for current Java and Kotlin, please see
