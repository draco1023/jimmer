title: Generate Client Code
---

In this series of articles, we will introduce generating client code. 

This client code generation is groundbreaking:

-   Different API model

    Considering server and client have completely different responsibilities and needs, letting them adopt totally different but most suitable models for each side.

-   Error translation

    For web clients, translating various Java/Kotlin exceptions on the server side to a TypeScript exception system that takes full advantage of IDE auto-complete.
