:::info
@`org.babyfish.jimmer.sql.OnDissociate` is used together with [Save Command](../../mutation/save-command) and [Delete Command](../../mutation/delete-command) in mutation section.  
:::

`@OnDissociate` can only be used on many-to-one associations mapped by foreign keys, such as:

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java title="Book.java"
@Entity
public interface Book {

    @Nullable
    @ManyToOne
    @OnDissociate(DissociateAction.SET_NULL)
    BookStore store();
    ...
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">  

```kotlin title="Book.kt"
@Entity
interface Book {

    @ManyToOne
    @OnDissociate(DissociateAction.SET_NULL)
    val store: BookStore?
    ...
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

When 

-   the parent object is deleted,
-   or the parent discards some child objects (based on the object tree override behavior of the save command),  

the child object will be dissociated.

DissociateAction has 3 options, corresponding to the foreign key behaviors in the database:

-   NONE: The current foreign key does not support dissociation behavior, preventing its parent object from being deleted.
-   SET_NULL: Automatically clear the foreign key. For parent delete operations, it looks very much like `on delete set null`.
-   DELETE: Automatically delete child objects. For parent delete operations, it looks very much like `on delete cascade`.

This article only introduces the configuration of OnDissociate. For how to use it further, please refer to [SaveCommand/Dissociation](../../mutation/save-command/dissociation) and [Delete Command](../../mutation/delete-command).
