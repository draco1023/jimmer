## Feature Description

Without Jimmer's support, implementing GraphQL queries requires two types of work:

-   Query aggregate roots

    This is work that needs to be done when developing any data service, whether it's a GraphQL service, REST service, or even a service using other custom protocols.
    
    Developers only need to query and return standalone aggregate root objects without considering their association properties. So this is a relatively simple development task.

    For [Spring GraphQL](https://spring.io/projects/spring-graphql), just add the `@QueryMapping` annotation to the query methods in controller classes.

-   Query association properties and calculated properties

    This is the bulk of the work required to implement GraphQL queries, requiring consideration of all current object associations and batch loading. There is some workload involved.

    In other words, it is precisely because the server undertakes these responsibilities that using GraphQL feels free, convenient and powerful on the client side.

    For [Spring GraphQL](https://spring.io/projects/spring-graphql), some schemes are provided for querying association properties, such as

    -   [@SchemaMapping](https://docs.spring.io/spring-graphql/docs/current/reference/html/#controllers.schema-mapping)
    -   [Batch Loading](https://docs.spring.io/spring-graphql/docs/current/reference/html/#execution.batching) 
    -   [@BatchMapping](https://docs.spring.io/spring-graphql/docs/current/reference/html/#controllers.batch-mapping)

When using Jimmer to implement GraphQL queries, developers only need to focus on querying aggregate roots, just ensuring that these aggregate roots have simple scalar fields. This is because

:::tip
All association properties and calculated properties of entity objects are automatically mapped to GraphQL fields by Jimmer without any development.
:::  

:::caution
So far, the GraphQL protocol does not support recursive queries for self-associated properties.

Therefore, it is not possible to expose functionality like [recursive queries in object fetchers](../query/object-fetcher/recursive) through GraphQL. This is a functionality sacrifice that must currently be accepted when using GraphQL. 
:::

## Example Code 

Jimmer automatically maps entity object association properties and calculated properties to GraphQL fields, so developers only need to implement queries for aggregate roots. The code is very simple, as follows:

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">  

```java title="BookStoreService.java"
package com.example.business;

import org.springframework.graphql.data.method.annotation.Argument;
// highlight-next-line
import org.springframework.graphql.data.method.annotation.QueryMapping;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;

...other imports omitted...

@Controller
public class BookStoreService {

    private final BookStoreRepsitory bookStoreRepsitory;

    public BookStoreService(BookStoreRepsitory bookStoreRepsitory) {
        this.bookStoreRepsitory = bookStoreRepsitory;
    }

    // highlight-next-line
    @QueryMapping
    public List<BookStore> bookStores(
            @Argument @Nullable String name
    ) {
        return bookStoreRepository.findByNameLikeOrderByName(name);
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin title="BookStoreService.kt" 
package com.example.business

import org.springframework.graphql.data.method.annotation.Argument
// highlight-next-line
import org.springframework.graphql.data.method.annotation.QueryMapping
import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller

...other imports omitted...

@Controller
class BookStoreService(
    private val bookStoreRepository: BookStoreRepsitory
) {

    // highlight-next-line
    @QueryMapping
    fun bookStores(
        @Argument name: String?
    ): List<BookStore> {
        return bookStoreRepository.findByNameLikeOrderByName(name)
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Where `BookStoreRepository` is defined as follows:

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java title="BookStoreRepository.java"  
public interface BookStoreRepository extends JRepository<BookStore, Long> {

    List<BookStore> findByNameLikeOrderByName(@Nullable String name);
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin title="BookStoreRepository.kt"
interface BookStoreRepository : KRepository<BookStore, Long> {

    fun findByNameLikeOrderByName(name: String?): List<BookStore>
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Unlike previous REST services, this example does **not** use [object fetchers](../query/object-fetcher) and simply returns the simplest standalone objects, which contain neither association properties nor calculated properties.

Here, `BookStoreRepository.findByNameLikeOrderByName` is an abstract method. If declarative queries are used, use the simplest `select(table)` rather than `select(table.fetch(...))`. 

:::tip
When using Jimmer to implement GraphQL, [object fetchers](../query/object-fetcher) are replaced by GraphQL mechanisms.

Therefore, do **NOT** use object fetchers, just return simple objects directly.

## Running Effect

In the accompanying example, the GraphQL related projects are:

|Language|Example| 
|---|---|
|Java|[example/java/jimmer-sql-graphql](https://github.com/babyfish-ct/jimmer/tree/main/example/java/jimmer-sql-graphql)|
|Kotlin|[example/kotlin/jimmer-sql-graphql-kt](https://github.com/babyfish-ct/jimmer/tree/main/example/kotlin/jimmer-sql-graphql-kt)|

Select any project, open and start it. Finally, use the browser to visit http://localhost:8080/graphiql
:::note
Be careful, it's /graph**i**ql, not /graphql
:::

Execute the request:

```
query {
  bookStores {
    id
    name
    avgPrice ❶
    books { ❷
      id
      name
      edition
      price
      authors { ❸
        id
        firstName
        fullName
        gender
      }
    }
  }
}
```

-   ❶ Query calculated property `BookStore.avgPrice`

-   ❷ Query association property `BookStore.books` 

-   ❸ Query association property `Book.authors`

The return result is:

```json

It is easy to see that the execution effect of GraphQL is very similar to that of [object fetchers](../query/object-fetcher). This is also the reason for the earlier statement "object fetchers are replaced by GraphQL, do not use object fetchers".

:::tip
In fact, [object fetchers](../query/object-fetcher), which are very useful in non-GraphQL modes, are themselves the result of GraphQLization of ORM frameworks.
