## Features

### 1. Both dynamism and static
-   Brings dynamism into static language ORM frameworks, achieving flexible capabilities for operating on complex dynamic data structures without compromising the complete compile-time safety checks of static languages, eliminating DTO explosion and unafraid of engineering expansion and changing requirements.
-   Its innovative SQL DSL supports dynamic table joins and native SQL embedding, gracefully handling real-world complexity.

### 2. Powerful and easy cache
-   Focuses on business and reaping caching gains. CDC solutions decoupled from specific caching technologies are transparent to business code.
-   Automatic cache invalidation.
-   Supports numerous application scenarios like object cache, association cache, calculation cache.
-   Mature multi-view cache mechanisms easily integrate with permission requirements.

### 3. Convenient project support
Provides a one-stop solution for business system development.
-   Supports client code generation.
-   Simplifies REST and GraphQL service development.
-   Supports cross-service data associations.

### 4. Ultimate performance
-   Pursues meticulous optimizations, rejecting low-performance SQL generation.
-   Powerful precompilation technology ensures efficient mapping from JDBC result sets to entity objects.

### 5. Low and controllable learning costs
Requires no special prior knowledge - veterans of any ORM can quickly and painlessly migrate. The learning curve is scientifically friendly, serving as a high-quality reference for new learners of ORM usage.

### 6. Rapid reuse of code assets
The combination of static and dynamic design realizes a higher level of abstraction from relational data to local graph structures. The high-performance one-stop solution isolates complex technical details, strongly supporting a focus on core business and rapid accumulation of highly reusable code assets.
